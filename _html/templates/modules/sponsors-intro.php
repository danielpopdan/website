            <h2>Why would you become a sponsor?</h2>
            <p>Sponsoring the Drupalcamp is an excellent opportunity to promote your business in an environment of innovative technologies such as the Drupal community and OpenSource values, and also to give you a chance to connect with talent and clients who are attending the Drupalcamp. Drupalcamp is a non-commercial event and sponsorship is vital for our success. The event is organized and run entirely by volunteers, but there are obviously costs to be covered.</p>
            <p class="section-intro-details-highlight">10% discount for previous sponsors and a 10% discount for early bird sponsor packages. Early bird sponsor packages end on March 1, 2018.</p>
