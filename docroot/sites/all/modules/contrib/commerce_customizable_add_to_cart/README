This module is an extension of Drupal Commerce [1] that provides a display
 formatter (based on the original) for the Commerce Product reference field.

Features:
 * Line-item type by Product type.
 * Product selection widget:
    - Select List
    - Radio buttons
    - Table select
 * Possibility to add fields rendering of the product in the rows of the
 table select. Ideal to show the color of the product with the help of the
 module: Field Extractor. [2]
 * Ajax setting for progress type and message.


I will be adding new features, suggestions are accepted.
